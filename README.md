# Discovery Seminar Simulation

This is a small project born out of the Oxford College GroupMe. The goal of this project is to simulate the ranking and placement process for discovery seminars this fall. The program currently does not take into account varied preferences between seminars; this will be added at the conclusion of a poll I'm conducting on freshmen's first choice of seminar

The function single_placement_sim takes the number of classes, the max class size, the number of students, and the number of allowed placements and returns a dictionary containing each possible rank as key and the number of students recieving each rank. The function simulate_dsc() takes all aformentioned arguments along with the number of iterations the user wants to simulate and returns a list of 2 dictonaries, the first of which contains the average number of students recieving each rank and the second containing these values as a percentage of the total student body.
